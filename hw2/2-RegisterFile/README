The test pattern is generated by the source file `pattern_gen.c`
The input pattern will be written to "stdout"
The output pattern will be written to "stderr"

One can leave the patterns already inside the directory "2-RegisterFile"
Or can generate a new pattern as following:

Compile:
	gcc pattern_gen.c -std=c99
Execute (under dir "2-RegisterFile"):
	./a.out >pattern.in 2>pattern.out.golden

The register_file_tb.v will read file "pattern.in" and "pattern.out.golden" to 
verify the correctness of our design
